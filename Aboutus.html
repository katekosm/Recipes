            <h1 class="headline">Our History</h1>
            <p class="text">Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes. (Here’s more of that story.) Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash, a New York-based media company.</p>

We strive to be a resource for every home cook, and we consciously work to make this inclusion felt in every part of the site, from the individuals we hire to the recipes we share.</p>
